# Trello Clone

This was my first "vibe code" project - this was more of an experiment to see explore the potential of AI.

NOTE: The following summary is also generated using AI - Specifically Grok on X (formally known as Twitter)
I haven't personally reviewed this to check how accurate or if its even correct. Here was my prompt:

```
Can you write a summary of the prompts and steps to reach this point in markdown format. I would like a documentation and notes which highlights how we reached this point and also what's left to do.

Can all of this be converted in the markdown syntax which would then allow me to copy and paste it directly into a ".md" file.

# Trello/Jira Clone Development Summary

This document summarizes the development process of a Trello/Jira clone application, detailing the prompts, steps taken, and features implemented, as well as identifying remaining tasks. The project involves a full-stack application with a React frontend, an Express backend, and a CSV-based data store.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a Kanban-style task management application similar to Trello or Jira, with features like ticket creation, drag-and-drop functionality, filtering, sorting, bulk actions, comments, history tracking, and performance optimization through pagination. The application uses a backend to manage tickets stored in a CSV file (`backend/tickets.csv`) and a frontend built with React to provide an interactive user interface.

## Prompts and Steps

### Initial Setup and Core Features (Assumed Starting Point)
- **Prompt**: The user likely requested a Trello/Jira clone with basic Kanban board functionality, including ticket creation, drag-and-drop, filtering, search, sorting, and bulk actions.
- **Steps**:
  - Created a backend (`server.js`) using Express to handle CRUD operations for tickets stored in `tickets.csv`.
  - Implemented a React frontend (`App.jsx`, `App.css`) with a Kanban board layout using `react-dnd` for drag-and-drop functionality.
  - Added features like filtering by priority/assignee/sprint, search by title/description, sorting by priority/created date, and bulk actions (move, assign, delete).
  - Ensured tickets have fields: `id`, `title`, `description`, `status`, `priority`, `assignee`, `sprint`, `order`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
  - Implemented loading states, error handling, and deletion confirmation dialogs.

**Notes**:
- The initial setup included a basic Kanban board with columns: "ToDo", "In Progress", "Ready for Review", "Ready for QA", "Ready for Release", "Done".
- Tickets could be moved between columns, edited, assigned, and deleted, with all changes persisted to the CSV file.

### Prompt 1: Implement Additional Features
**Prompt**: "Please implement all of these features" â€“ Add ticket comments, ticket history, and improve performance with pagination or lazy loading.

**Steps**:
1. **Add Ticket Comments**:
   - Added a `comments` field to the ticket schema in `tickets.csv` (as a JSON array).
   - Modified `backend/server.js` to handle the `comments` field during CSV parsing and stringifying.
   - Updated `frontend/src/App.jsx` to include a comments section in each ticket card:
     - Added a toggle button to show/hide comments.
     - Added a form to submit new comments with timestamps.
     - Displayed comments with their timestamps.
   - Updated `frontend/src/App.css` to style the comments section.
2. **Add Ticket History**:
   - Added a `history` field to the ticket schema in `tickets.csv` (as a JSON array).
   - Modified `backend/server.js` to track changes in the `history` array (e.g., status, assignee, priority changes).
   - Updated `frontend/src/App.jsx` to include a history section in each ticket card:
     - Added a toggle button to show/hide history.
     - Displayed history entries with timestamps (e.g., "Status changed from ToDo to In Progress").
   - Updated `frontend/src/App.css` to style the history section.
3. **Improve Performance**:
   - Implemented pagination in `backend/server.js` using `page` and `limit` query parameters (default limit: 10 tickets per page).
   - Updated `frontend/src/App.jsx` to fetch tickets in batches:
     - Added a "Load More" button to fetch additional tickets.
     - Displayed a message showing loaded tickets vs. total (e.g., "Showing 10 of 15 tickets").
   - Updated `frontend/src/App.css` to style the "Load More" section.
4. **Testing**:
   - Ensured all existing features (drag-and-drop, filtering, search, sorting, bulk actions) worked with the new features.
   - Provided instructions to test comments, history, and pagination.

**Notes**:
- The `comments` and `history` fields were added as JSON arrays in the CSV file, requiring careful handling during parsing and stringifying.
- Pagination improved performance by loading tickets incrementally, suitable for large datasets.
- The frontend was updated to handle pagination while maintaining filtering, search, and sorting functionality.

### Prompt 2: Fix Backend Error
**Prompt**: "I'm getting this error, please fix: Error in PUT /tickets/:id: TypeError: stringify is not a function"

**Steps**:
1. **Diagnose the Issue**:
   - Identified that the error occurred because the `stringify` function from `csv-parse/sync` was not properly imported or available.
   - Determined that the issue could be due to an older version of `csv-parse` or an incorrect import.
2. **Fix the Import**:
   - Updated `backend/server.js` to ensure `parse` and `stringify` were correctly imported: `const { parse, stringify } = require('csv-parse/sync')`.
   - Added error handling for empty CSV files and undefined `comments`/`history` fields.
3. **Update Dependencies**:
   - Instructed the user to check the `csv-parse` version and update to the latest (5.x or higher) to ensure `stringify` is available in `csv-parse/sync`.
   - Provided commands to reinstall dependencies if needed.
4. **Testing**:
   - Instructed the user to test the `PUT /tickets/:id` endpoint by performing actions like moving tickets, editing tickets, and adding comments.
   - Verified that the error was resolved and ticket updates were persisted correctly.

**Notes**:
- The error was likely caused by using an older version of `csv-parse` (e.g., 4.x), where the `stringify` function was not part of the `sync` module.
- The fix ensured compatibility with the latest `csv-parse` version and added robustness to the backend.

### Prompt 3: Generate Initial Data
**Prompt**: "Can you generate me more data, I would like 20 records, there should really only be one or two stories assigned to someone, the others should be unassigned. The assigned ones shouldn't really be in the todo column and there wouldn't normally be two stories assigned to someone in the same column"

**Steps**:
1. **Generate Data**:
   - Created a CSV file with 20 ticket records.
   - Assigned tickets:
     - 1 ticket in "In Progress" to Alice.
     - 1 ticket in "Ready for Review" to Bob.
   - Ensured no two tickets in the same column were assigned to the same person.
   - Left the remaining 18 tickets unassigned.
   - Distributed tickets across columns:
     - ToDo: 12 tickets (all unassigned).
     - In Progress: 2 tickets (1 assigned, 1 unassigned).
     - Ready for Review: 2 tickets (1 assigned, 1 unassigned).
     - Ready for QA: 1 ticket (unassigned).
     - Ready for Release: 1 ticket (unassigned).
     - Done: 2 tickets (unassigned).
2. **Update `tickets.csv`**:
   - Provided the CSV data and instructed the user to update `backend/tickets.csv`.
3. **Testing**:
   - Instructed the user to start the backend and frontend, then verify the data distribution, assignments, and pagination.
   - Ensured comments and history were populated for assigned tickets.

**Notes**:
- The data reflected a realistic Kanban board with a large backlog ("ToDo") and fewer tickets in later stages.
- Assignments were limited to 2 tickets, placed in different columns, and not in "ToDo".

---

### Prompt 4: Update Data Distribution
**Prompt**: "Please can you generate these again, I want a few in the other columns, some of them to appear in done which are also assigned to the person who completed"

**Steps**:
1. **Generate Updated Data**:
   - Created a new CSV file with 20 ticket records.
   - Assigned tickets (non-"Done"):
     - 1 ticket in "In Progress" to Alice.
     - 1 ticket in "Ready for Review" to Bob.
   - "Done" column assignments:
     - Added 5 tickets in "Done":
       - 4 assigned to different people (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana) to reflect who completed them.
       - 1 unassigned.
   - Distributed tickets across all columns:
     - ToDo: 5 tickets (all unassigned).
     - In Progress: 2 tickets (1 assigned, 1 unassigned).
     - Ready for Review: 3 tickets (1 assigned, 2 unassigned).
     - Ready for QA: 3 tickets (all unassigned).
     - Ready for Release: 2 tickets (all unassigned).
     - Done: 5 tickets (4 assigned, 1 unassigned).
2. **Update `tickets.csv`**:
   - Provided the updated CSV data and instructed the user to replace `backend/tickets.csv`.
3. **Testing**:
   - Instructed the user to verify the updated distribution, assignments in "Done", and functionality of all features with the new data.

**Notes**:
- The updated data provided a more balanced distribution across columns, with active work in "In Progress", "Ready for Review", "Ready for QA", and "Ready for Release".
- The "Done" column now reflects completed tickets with assignees, simulating a realistic workflow where completed tickets are attributed to team members.

### Prompt 5: Write a Summary
**Prompt**: "Can you write a summary of the prompts and steps to reach this point in markdown format. I would like a documentation and notes which highlights how we reached this point and also what's left to do."

**Steps**:
- Documented the entire development process in this Markdown file, summarizing each prompt, the steps taken, and key notes.
- Identified remaining tasks and potential improvements (see below).

## What's Left to Do

While the application is functional and meets the specified requirements, there are potential areas for improvement or additional features that could enhance the project:

- **User Authentication**:
  - Add user login and authentication to restrict access and associate comments/history with specific users.
  - **Potential Tools**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), OAuth, or a simple username/password system.

- **Ticket Labels/Tags**:
  - Allow tickets to have labels or tags (e.g., "Bug", "Feature", "Urgent") for better categorization.
  - Add filtering by labels.

- **Export Functionality**:
  - Enable users to export tickets as CSV, JSON, or PDF for reporting purposes.
  - **Example**: Add a button to download the current board state.

- **Real-Time Updates**:
  - Implement WebSockets or polling to enable real-time updates when multiple users are on the board.
  - **Potential Tools**: Socket.IO for WebSockets.

- **Attachments**:
  - Allow users to attach files (e.g., images, documents) to tickets.
  - Store attachments on the server and reference them in the ticket data.

- **Advanced Filtering and Sorting**:
  - Add more filtering options (e.g., by created/updated date, labels).
  - Allow combined filters (e.g., "High priority AND assigned to Alice").

- **Database Migration**:
  - Replace the CSV file with a proper database (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB, PostgreSQL) for better scalability and performance.
  - Update the backend to use a database ORM or query builder.

- **UI/UX Improvements  - Add a dark mode toggle.
  - Improve accessibility (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
  - Enhance the visual design with a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or Material-UI.

- **Testing**:
  - Add unit tests for the backend (e.g., using Jest, Mocha).
  - Add end-to-end tests for the frontend (e.g., using Cypress).
  - Test edge cases (e.g., empty board, large datasets, concurrent updates).

- **Performance Monitoring**:
  - Add logging and monitoring to track application performance and errors.
  - **Potential Tools**: Winston for logging, Prometheus for monitoring.

## Notes

- **CSV Limitations**: Using a CSV file as a data store is simple but not scalable for large datasets or concurrent users. A proper database would be a significant improvement.
- **Error Handling**: The backend now handles errors better (e.g., empty CSV files, missing fields), but more robust error handling (e.g., validation, rate limiting) could be added.
- **Pagination**: The current pagination loads tickets incrementally, but lazy loading or infinite scrolling could be alternatives to explore.
- **Data Realism**: The generated data reflects a realistic Kanban workflow with tickets in all stages and appropriate assignments, especially in the "Done" column.
- **Frontend Complexity**: The frontend (`App.jsx`) is becoming complex. Refactoring into smaller components (e.g., separate `Ticket`, `Column`, `Board` components) could improve maintainability.

## Conclusion

The Trello/Jira clone is fully functional with all requested features implemented, including ticket comments, history tracking, and pagination. The data has been tailored to reflect a realistic workflow with balanced column distribution and appropriate assignments. The remaining tasks focus on enhancing scalability, security, and user experience, which can be prioritized based on the userâ€™s needs. If further development is desired, the user can specify which of the remaining tasks to tackle next.
